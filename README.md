# Zookeeper

This is a core Java assignment. We practiced:
- implementing packages to namespace our project
- implementing inheritance

For this assignment, we are building a Java app that can track animals' energy levels for a zookeeper. We are given a rare bat and a gorilla to track their energy levels and create action methods for.
